## Community Starter Projects

The Battlesnake community is all about collaboration and shared learning. Some of our core members and supporters have built their own Starter Projects to get developers started with new languages and technologies.

* [Node.js Starter Snake with Microsoft Azure](https://github.com/mcraealex/AzureSnake) by [McRaeAlex](https://github.com/McRaeAlex)

### Machine Learning Starter Projects

These projects are specifically intended for developers wishing to use machine learning techniques and technologies to develop their Battlesnake.

* [Machine Learning Battlesnake with Amazon Sagemaker](https://github.com/awslabs/sagemaker-battlesnake-ai) by [AWS Labs](https://github.com/awslabs)

{% hint style="info" %}
These projects are maintained independently by their developers. See individual contributing guides if you're interested in getting involved and helping out.

## Contributing Your Own Starter Project

**Want to submit your Starter Project to this list?** Wonderful!

You can submit a [pull request or create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/BattlesnakeOfficial/docs) and we'll take a look. Community created Starter Projects must follow these guidelines in order to be approved:

* Contain just enough code to run a simple Battlesnake and nothing more
* Return hardcoded responses to all requests
* Be well documented and easy to understand
* Provide simple, extensible unit tests
* Ideally have a minimal project structure
