# Ending Support for Battlesnake API Version 0

Battlesnake API Version 1 was released in May 2020 and is the new standard which all Battlesnakes should be implemented with. At this point, new feature development on play.battlesnake.com now depends on API Version 1 features in order to work. 

Starting on October 12th, 2020 we will begin phasing out support for Version 0 of the Battlesnake API on [play.battlesnake.com](https://play.battlesnake.com/). All developers should upgrade their Battlesnakes to Version 1 of the API in order to keep accessing all the features of the site. We have provided a [Migrating to API Version 1](../guides/migrating-to-api-version-1.md) guide to assist you with the upgrade.

### **October 12, 2020** - Disable Customizations 

Games created with API Version 0 Battlesnakes will no longer show user defined customizations such as head, tail and color selections.  Instead, the default head and tail will be used and a randomized color will be provided.
