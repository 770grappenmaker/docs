  all over the world.

# Overview

**Developers of all skill levels** use Battlesnake to learn new technologies, improve their programming skills, and have fun with friends, family, and colleagues.

**Battlesnake is an autonomous survival game.** Each Battlesnake is controlled autonomously by a live web server and moves independently attempting to find food, avoid other Battlesnakes, and stay alive as long as possible.

Anyone can play Battlesnake, either by training with the solo challenges or by competing in online tournaments. Success at the highest level requires creativity, unique strategies, and excellent programming.

Our mission is **to make it fun and accessible for anyone to become a better programmer**.
