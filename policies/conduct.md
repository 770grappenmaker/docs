# Battlesnake Community Code of Conduct
[![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.0-4baaaa.svg)](code_of_conduct.md) 

We created Battlesnake as a way to have fun programming with friends, learn new skills and technologies, and build the communities around us. We firmly believe that encouraging more people to experience and enjoy programming at all levels will make the world a better place. To this end we have created a Community with a focus on building experiences which are:

### Accessible
Battlesnake is for everyone. Whether you are new to programming or have been a professional developer for 30+ years, you can find a place at Battlesnake to learn, grow and be successful. Everyone should have the tools, support, and access to code, collaborate and compete at Battlesnake.

### Inclusive
Battlesnake is an inclusive community. This means we are welcoming and respectful of all Battlesnake community members. As our community grows and more people join with different backgrounds and skills, we will see a stronger and more vibrant community.

### Collaborative
Battlesnake is a place for collaboration. Developers from around the world are here to learn, grow, and connect with other developers. At all times you should take a collaborative approach to any problem that is presented, whether it is technical or not.

{% hint style="info" %}
By adopting this Code of Conduct, Battlesnake community members commit themselves to fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect of Battlesnake and its communities. Any persons who do not follow this Code of Conduct may be permanently removed from the Battlesnake platform and barred from all future events.

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at

* Email: [**incidents@battlesnake.com**](mailto:incidents@battlesnake.com)

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Attribution
