## Battlesnake Code of Conduct

TL;DR. Be respectful. Harassment and abuse are never tolerated. If you are in a situation that makes you uncomfortable at any type of Battlesnake Event \(Live in-person, Virtual online, Community organized\), if the event itself is creating an unsafe or inappropriate environment, or if interacting with a Battlesnake representative or event organizer makes you uncomfortable, please report it using the procedures included in this document.

Battlesnake \(Battlesnake Inc.\) stands for inclusivity and accessibility. We believe that every single person has the right to have a safe and welcoming environment.

Harassing behaviour in any form will not be tolerated. Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, social class, economic status, veteran status, sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. If what youâ€™re doing is making someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as harassment and is enough reason to stop doing it.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately. Sponsors, judges, mentors, volunteers, organizers, Battlesnake staff, and anyone else at the event are also subject to this code of conduct. In particular, attendees should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material both in their avatars and during the event. Booth staff \(including volunteers\) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, Battlesnake Inc. may take any action it deems appropriate, including warning the offender, expulsion from the event, ban from future Battlesnake events and the Battlesnake platform and disqualification from any tournament\(s\) with no eligibility for reimbursement or refund of any type.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Battlesnake Inc. using the reporting procedures defined below.

Battlesnake Inc. representatives will be happy to help participants contact security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all Battlesnake events, any and all online interactions, on the Battlesnake platform and at any Battlesnake related community events.
