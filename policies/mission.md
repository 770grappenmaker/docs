# Mission and Values

## Our Mission

**Is to make it fun and accessible for anyone to become a better programmer.**

We created Battlesnake to have fun programming with friends, learn new skills and technologies, and build the communities around us. 

We believe that encouraging more people to gain real experience and enjoy programming at all levels makes the world a better place.

## Our Values

These values drive us towards our mission.

### Celebrate success at all skill levels

Creating a Battlesnake that is highly competitive should be a celebrated accomplishment. Creating your first Battlesnake, no matter how simple, should be celebrated equally.

### Encourage collaboration over competition

Even though Battlesnake involves a competitive game, participants, partners, volunteers, and our team members are working together to help everyone be successful.

### Support real-world skill development

When it comes to programming technologies, we work hard to ensure developers can experiment with and use "the real thing". This includes programming languages, editors, version control, platforms, etc.

### Embrace open-source software

We firmly believe in the power of open-source collaboration. We strive to code in public as much as possible and we encourage developers to do the same.

### Build powerful communities

We work hard to encourage, grow, and support communities of all shapes and sizes. Anyone who wants to participate, organize, or volunteer should feel welcome and supported. Anyone with ideas should feel heard and appreciated.

### Include everyone

Battlesnake should be exciting for everyone. Even if you don't know how to program, or don't care to learn, Battlesnake should be fun and exhilarating for everyone involved.
